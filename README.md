#GraphQL

The provided code sets up an Apollo Server using Express.js to create a GraphQL API. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Importing Dependencies:**
   - The code imports various dependencies using the `import` statement. These dependencies include:
     - `express`: A web framework for Node.js used to create the Express application.
     - `ApolloServer`: The main class for creating an Apollo Server instance.
     - `startStandaloneServer`: A function from Apollo Server Standalone that starts the server.
     - `cors`: Middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
     - `bodyParser`: Middleware that parses incoming request bodies.

2. **Creating the Express Application:**
   - The code initializes an Express application using `express()`, assigning it to the `app` variable.

3. **Middleware Setup:**
   - `cors()` enables CORS for the Express application, allowing cross-origin requests.
   - `bodyParser.json()` is used to parse JSON request bodies.

4. **Defining the GraphQL Schema (Type Definitions):**
   - The code defines the GraphQL schema using the `typeDefs` constant, which is a string containing the schema written in GraphQL's Schema Definition Language (SDL).
   - The schema defines several types: `User`, `Address`, `GeoLocation`, `Company`, and `Post`.
   - Each type has fields with their respective types and relationships to other types.

5. **Resolvers:**
   - The code defines the resolver functions that resolve the queries defined in the schema.
   - The `Query` object in the `resolvers` defines resolver functions for the available queries: `getUser`, `getAllUsers`, `getPost`, `getAllPosts`, and `getPostsByUserId`.
   - The `User` and `Post` types have additional resolver functions for the `posts` and `user` fields, respectively.

6. **Creating the Apollo Server:**
   - The code creates a new instance of `ApolloServer` by passing the `typeDefs` and `resolvers` to the constructor.
   - The `ApolloServer` instance is assigned to the `server` variable.

7. **Starting the Server:**
   - The code uses `startStandaloneServer` to start the Apollo Server.
   - The server is configured to listen on port 8000.
   - The returned `url` is logged to the console, indicating that the server is ready.
